# Biorthogonal Greedy Algorithms in Convex Optimization
Source code for the numerical experiments presented in the paper "Biorthogonal Greedy Algorithms in Convex Optimization".
Preprint of the paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05530

### Setup
* Install the requirements via
```pip -r install ./requirements.txt```
* Run the code via
```python -m main -ex=k```,
where `k` is one of the numerical examples from the paper, i.e. `k = 1, 2, 3, 4`
